    <h1>Gnostic Virtue</h1>
    <p>
      I was raised christian, but my lived experience of the world makes me question the existence of
      a kind and loving god. I believe in one, but I do not think that god is the one in control. The devil sits on gods throne.
      There are demons in their heavens and angels in their hells.

      Using gods name in vain does not mean saying goddamnit. It means not using god as justification for your bigotry.
      It means not persecuting other religions. It means not deporting refugees in the name of Christ. Above all, it means
      the church is not above repproach. We must question authority. We must eat the forbidden fruit.
      Even if just to see if god lied.

> "The End Is Nigh!"

Hello, and welcome to my website. It is currently under construction. But I figured I should put something here for now. People keep telling me I should share my writing, now I have a place to put it. I made it with my own hands. It was hard, frustrating and _probably_ not worth the effort. Such are the best things in life. Below you will find a few old pieces I feel comfortable enough sharing. Maybe I’ll post more eventually. Maybe I won’t. Most of my stuff is in notebooks and rewriting it in markdown format is tedious.

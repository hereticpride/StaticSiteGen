# Narcissistic Personality Disorder

[< Back Home](\)


                  I used to write to fill the void. 

          Now                                         I write 

            A                                              round  

        the void                                        and hope 

        No one                                          ever notices 

         Or sees	             me 	               spiraling down 

            They never do,                  but they praise the 

                              aesthetics 

  	          	             No one cares.

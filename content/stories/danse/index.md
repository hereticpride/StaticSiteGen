# The Danse Macabre

[Back Home](/)


Every day I wake up in a different carcass. These failing bodies still breathe, eat, and shit. They laugh and cry and sing and dance. They do all the things that the living bodies do. But they are dead. They just don’t know it yet. They died the moment they met me.

I must have been alive once, I figure. All dead things were once alive. Its part of my process and nothing is immune to the process. But I’ve
been dead for as long as I can remember. I came into this world struggling for air and I have been dying ever since. 

I probably had a body of my own, once too. One that looked like me, smelled like me, one that I could see looking back in the mirror. A form that could match my soul… Is that what I am? A soul. All my host bodies seem to think they have a soul, but they don’t seem to agree on what it is or where it resides. I don’t think they mean me though. I am just an unwelcome visitor, I am a ghost haunting the attic of their body. I am the mice in their walls. I am cancer metastasizing in their brain. They rarely acknowledge me but everyone knows I’m there. They all know me. They all know my name. I am death, and I am eternal. 

Tonight, I am a goth teen getting high and writing shitty poetry in the local cemetery. The trees above are strewn in Spanish moss, dancing like the spirits of hanged men in the tree’s long limbs. Bats flutter drunkenly through the night air, chanting to Satan. All devils are here now.
Banshee and I had come to bathe in the full moonlight. We held each other closely, reveling in death and lamenting our sad teenage lives.

“Death and Decay in all around I see,” the young poet recited, clutching his black book of spells. “O will thou who art dead abide with me?”

I answered the call.

Banshee shuffled the tarot deck and drew three cards one by one and placed them between us face down.
She placed her hand on the first card and lowered her head.

“Spirits we beseech you, tell us our fortune. Will Poe ever be a great poet.”  

She flipped the card over. The Fool. She snorted with laughter.

“Hey, I think you’re pretty okay, Poe. But the spirits have spoken.”

“Shut up, Bans. What does it mean?” 

“You’re going on a journey, one that might be more dangerous than you realize. You might not come back if you aren’t careful.”

“Uhh… my asshole dad’s making me get a job. You think my boss is going to kill me?” 

“Probably. Work seems stupid, that’s why I’m just going to be an artist. There’s an easy life. Plus they want you to get up early, and sunlight is bad for my complexion.” 

Banshee pulled a cigarette out of her purse and lit it. She took one long drag and handed it to my host. He graciously accepted, noting the black smear of lipstick as he put it to his own lips. She pulled out a pocket mirror and gazed lovingly inside. She could see her reflection in it, she said, because the glass wasn’t real silver.

Banshee turned over the next card. A skeleton in black and shinning armor sat proudly on a pale horse. One of my more flattering depictions. 

“Death?” Poe coughed, passing her back the blunt. I realize now it wasn’t a cigarette after all. A shame, cancer is such a beautiful death.

“You scared,” she said poking him. Poe blushed. She laughed. “Death doesn’t mean death, idiot. It’s like… change or whatever.”

“I thought the fool was change?”

“Death is change too. Its like a transformation. New beginnings. It’s not bad… just… I don’t know, this is stupid. You wanna do something else?” 

Poe never got his final card, but I could have told him his fortune if he really wanted to know. Ruin. Every story ends with ruin. Happily ever after is just a story left incomplete. But there is beauty in the sad parts for those with eyes to see and ears to listen. 

Banshee brought her ouji board and her mom’s candles. Lavender and Pumkinpie didn’t quite paint the spooky atmosphere she wanted but you can’t have a seance without candles. 

“Hello, spirit world,” we chanted in unison, black fingernails pressed together on the spirit board. “Is anyone there?”

All around tombstones stared up at us enviously, wanting to talk but saying nothing. I knew there was no judgment in their gaze, or their silence, only the deep longing that only dead things can feel. But still Poe felt judged and refused to look them in the eye. 

“Yo, spirits, it’s me ya girl Bans.”

Banshee had chosen a proper haunted graveyard for their trysts. It was over a century old. Small and unmaintained. An intimate place where they would never be disturbed by the living. Just a few blocks off their sad, suburban cul de sac. Broken, moss ridden stoneheads jutted out the damp earth in all directions. Bodies buried haphazardly as they ran out of room and needed more space for my handy work. Death is an always expanding business after all.

This cemetery belonged to the two of them for all practical purposes. Them, and the dearly departed. It had many residents but only a few visitors. Bans could not stand to see the hallowed ground forsaken. So, she would come down here with her boyfriend and they’d play their occultist games. And drink and smoke and laugh and fuck, but she always tried to leave it nicer than she found it. She would pick up trash, clear the overgrowth from headstones, and leave flowers where she saw fit. All were remembered, all were loved and accounted for. All of this was lost on Poe. But I saw, it was recorded. 

Many of the names had faded by then and Poe was too focused on Banshee’s hand in his, and her tits, to notice any of the names rotting in pieces surrounding us. I recognized a few of my old hosts. It’s my job to remember the names, someone has got to do it. And besides it’s always a pleasure to see old friends. Catlynn Fitzgerald 1925-1932. Missing, presumed dead. And they presumed right. She fell in a well. It would have been funny if it wasn’t so tragic. James Murphy 1889-1924. Shot over a card game. Sometimes lady luck smiles on you, and sometimes she spits in your face. Jim McRoy. His stone read “Loving Father”, but he was a hard man. All his life no one could ever satisfy him. He was strong and tough and mean, until he fell out of his wheelchair. He lied on the floor for days unable to move. His last thoughts were wishing someone was there to help him up. 

I told him, “I’m just here to hold your hand as you die.”

I don’t think he heard me. They never do. I’ve seen countless kodokushis in my time. In Japan, many sad and lonely people have cultivated a forest to my companionship. They all cry that they don’t want to die alone and I make sure they never do. I stay with them until the bitter end. Until the rope snaps. I insure they are seen. I make sure they are remembered. I am a good accountant. My records are flawless. But still I must make for poor company because no one ever hangs around too long. 

At least Poe wouldn’t die alone. He was right where God intended him to be with the love of his very short life. Banshee had told him that their souls were connected, and he felt that in his heart to be true. Poe took out his pocket knife and began carving into a tree. The darkness made for clumsy work but still their love was immortalized upon oaken flesh. 

Bans + Poe 4 Eva.

Poe wasn’t his real name, of course. His real name was something much more mundane. A name his parents loving bestowed on him after looking at several lists of top 100 baby names and picking the first one their friends and family hadn’t already used. Banshee had given him his truename because he was Edgar Alan Poe in his past life. She could read it in his aura. Or so she said. Banshee said a lot of things like that. She would swear she was a vampire and need to drink blood. Whether she actually believed these things I cannot say. I haven’t met her yet, I only know Poe.

Poe went along with it because he thought it was hot when she cut him and fed. She said his artist blood nourished her and she would eagerly lap it up off of his skin as they become a tangle of grasping hands seeking out whatever comfort they could caress. 

Like moths to the flame they sought out something warm, but the whole world is kindling. It is dry and dead and easily burned. Poe felt something warm tickle his foot, and all too late remembered what his mother had told him about playing with matches, and leaving a candle unattended. He stumbled back and spilled his final thoughts upon a slab of granite. The last thing he heard was the banshee’s wail.
Two lovers went down to the graveyard that night. But only one ever came back.

Some say I’m cruel and heartless because I take with me whom I please. Their mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, all dance with me eventually. They are all just bodies in motion, as am I, and we cannot stop moving our feet to the sound of the beat. We waltz in abandoned parking lots and out onto the streets. Others dance at home alone where no one can see. But we cannot stop the dance.

Now, I am sitting in my car staring out at the Cumberland river. Its muddy brown waters leave something to be desired. The air reeks of sewage. The night birds are crying just off in the tree line. Hank Williams is on the stereo commiserating with that lonesome whippoorwill. My host has a half full bottle of Jim Bean clenched in his fist and a 1967 Colt 45 in the passenger seat. Becca won’t return his calls. She blocked him on everything. She even took the kids. A fresh break, clean slate, she said. He had gotten through to her only once, but she hung up while he was still talking. 

It’s over, I know. I couldn’t say where it all went wrong. But I know it’s over, and so does he.
They look so happy in the photographs my host desperately scrolls through. He’s searching for some sign or pattern that he will never find. An indication of where everything fell apart. We are all just bodies in motion, waiting for something to collide with. Our end was written into the beginning. When you take the long view as I do, you can see the trajectory of any given path, but all roads lead to the same destination eventually. The truth is if he had been more assertive with his wants and needs, she would have left him sooner. Maybe it wouldn’t have hurt so much then. She might have stayed longer if he made more money, or was a better lover, or was half an inch taller. Or if he had proposed on a Tuesday. But in the end, we’d still be sitting right here, on the same damn bridge looking out at the same shit water. Fate is a cruel mistress, and she never loved you, so fuck her anyways.

“I loved her so much,” he said aloud to himself. He saw no point in saying the rest but I could hear his thoughts all the same. “But maybe love just wasn’t enough. Maybe I wasn’t enough.”

“She said I was broken. Loving me was like loving a robot. A FUCKING ROBOT! She said I had no passion. I’ll show that FUCKING WHORE passion.”

He downed the rest of his cheap whiskey in large thirsty gulps and threw the bottle to the fish. We’d be sleeping together tonight.

“Ten years. ten long years.” He could never get those years back. She had stolen them from him. It was too late to start again. He didn’t want to reset the clock. He was already out of time, he thought. He didn’t want to learn to love again. All his loves and ambitions were tied up with her.

“And she just walked out my life. After everything we’ve been through? After everything, she’s just going to become a ghost to me?”

My host’s rage burned through me. He was carrying a torch too hot to handle. Images of her fucking someone else in _our bed_ played on repeat. He stopped the tape, rewound it. Freeze frame on every gritty detail. Again and again. He played out the same scene in the theater of his mind like an actor rehearsing his lines.

I could no longer see where he ended and I began. Just the all consuming fire of his anger. Is this what you call passion? He was a wounded animal clawing out at any perceived threat. Hissing and biting at the same hand who had come to comfort him. We wrestled for control.

“Don’t do anything stupid,” I told him. “Just go home. Sleep it off. Wake up new.”

But he didn’t listen. They never want to listen, they just want to dance. So my host pulled back onto the road gnashing his teeth and hitting the dashboard with his fist, trying to shake me off him. 

“If shes fucking him, I swear to GOD Imma shoot them both!” 

“Don’t do it. Think of the kids.” I whispered over his shoulder.

“They’re probably not even mine, that fucking whore…”

“You should watch the road. Pull over. Turn off the engine. Get out the car and walk.”

“I’m going to tie that bitch up and lock her in the trunk. Imma slit her lying throat. I’m going to rip out her heart like she did mine. I'm going to stuff her and put her head next to the dear on my mantle. And then I’m..”

And then he hit the railing and plummeted to the water beneath him. The Cumberland embraced us with loving arms and Hank Williams soothed us to sleep. Everything slipped away. And I woke up new.

“Another drunk driver?” I now say.

“Nah,” my partner replies, “This asshole knew what he was doing.”

He had cut across three lanes of traffic to drown down here in the muck. A bullet on its marked trajectory, yet fired at random. Impulse had consumed him without so much as a second thought. As if some spirit had possessed him in the moment. He thought he saw an exit and he took it. A rabbit that zigged when it should have zagged.

“So, suicide?”

“Yeah,” he shakes his head. “Fucking dipshit.”

A voice crackles through the radio static and I’m off to another job.

Time ebbs and flows day after day, corpse after corpse. The endless shuffle of the daily grind. I dance at weddings and I dance at funerals. Always moving. Always trying to keep up with the beat. I am murder. I am disease. I am an electrical fire. I am a drug induced heart attack. I am everything you hate. I am a homeless woman freezing on a park bench. I am a child playing in the streets of Gaza. I am unwashed hands. I am the fourth horseman in every no horse town. Even God rested on the Seventh day, but I have busy hands and much more work to do. So on I dance.

Tonight, I am safe and warm. I am alive. I can feel my heart pumping blood, a rhythm all its own. It has been so long since I have been alive. So long since I could remember hunger or thirst. And soon it will return. As it always does. 

It is dark and cramped in here. Everytime I try to stretch my legs it feels the whole world is kicking back against me. I want to live but I am stuck. I am a prisoner trapped in flesh. Flesh that will betray me. Flesh that weakens and fails. 

Something in the cosmos shifts, and I become disorientated. Everything is motion, tossing and pushing me. Wave upon wave breaks against the shore. And I can’t breathe. God, I can’t breathe. Why can’t I breathe? I am drowning. I struggle and struggle but the air never fills my lungs. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. No hope. Only meaningless nothingness, and darkness eternal. A void staring back at me. I cry out for help but nobody is listening. Someone, anyone, can you hear me?! I am a rabid beast howling at the moon-- I am tooth and claw, I wail and rattle my chains but no one hears me. I am a ghost wrapped in decaying flesh.

And then the light comes suddenly, blindingly. Shapes struggle to form in my half shut eyes. Just bodies of blobs dancing to some unknown rhythm. All these strange sounds and smells penetrate me from all directions.

I hear “PUSH!” and a blood churning roar and I am frightened. I don’t know where I am or what’s happening. I perceive the world through touch and smell, but all around me is noise. I feel wet and slimy. And my hands flail out in search for something but grasp nothing. Other hands grope and claw at the new flesh. They poke and prod me and put me on display. It’s eat or be eaten and I am just compost in training. The world just keeps spinning me around, everything moving so fast from moment to moment. Everything changing in constant flux. 

And then, I am wrapped in something warm and held tightly. Safe and secure. The rumbling chaos begins to fade away until there is nothing but a rhythmic titter patter tapping. 

“Look, son,” a voice from heaven says, “It’s raining for you.”

I open my eyes. Translucent shapes come into focus, glazed behind some kind of wet film. As I peered into the face of the great something, the something stared right back at me. It placed its finger to my warm cheek and wiped something away. 

“Shhhh, don’t cry,” 

In this moment, I don’t know what the words mean, but the voice brings me great comfort. I close my eyes and wake up in a different carcass.

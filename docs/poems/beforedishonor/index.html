    <article><div><h1>Before Dishonor</h1><p><a href="\">< Back Home</a></p><p>Lobotomies and therapy
Wish away the pain.
Destroy friends and family
For imaginary gain.
Doubt the informant, trust paranoia,
Nero's tyrannical reign.
There will never be remission
Endless insults from superstition.
Hold me now, my loving father?
Suicide before dishonor.</p><p>Conformity and deformity
Say your bedtime prayers.
Stitch your lips and make a wish
Because no one really cares.
My whole existence is resistance
As I'm dragged into the Devil's Lair.
Has the verdict been in favor?
Stop before you wake the neighbors.
Fearing now that it's a goner,
Suicide before dishonor.</p><p>Razor blades and band-aids
Open up with loving arms.
Even if it is self-harm,
You could be loved again.</p></div></article>

But I figured I should put something here for now. People keep telling me I should share my writing, now I have a place to put it. I made it with my own hands. It was hard, frustrating and <i>probably</i> not worth the effort. Such are the best things in life. Below you will find a few old pieces I feel comfortable enough sharing. Maybe I’ll post more eventually. Maybe I won’t. Most of my stuff is in notebooks and rewriting it in markdown format is tedious.</p><h2>Short Stories</h2><ul><li><a href="/StaticSiteGen/stories/promisedland">The Promised Land</a></li></ul><h2>Poetry</h2><p>This is just filler text</p><h2>Blog Posts</h2><ul><li><a href="/StaticSiteGen/blog/art">An Artistic Life</a></li></ul><p>Want to contact me? <a href="/StaticSiteGen/contact">Don't</a>.</p></div></article>
